<h3>1. SR-Latch [0 point]</h3>
<p>
The SR-latch is the simplest memory element that can be constructed
from standard logic gates. It consists of a pair of NOR (or NAND) gates,
connected as shown in the figures below. The cross-coupling of the gates
creates a feedback loop that allows the output of the system to settle
to an 1-bit value, i.e., 1-bit values are stored in the system as
the current state.
The stored value is output on the line Q, and
its inverse on Q'. We can store a new value in the latch simply
by "pulsing" one of the two input lines.
Pulsing an input line means to momentarily assert
(i.e., gives a logically high or "1" value to) the input.
Thus, an input line is pulsed if it is asserted and then de-asserted.
SR-latch has two inputs, <b><i>Set</i></b> and <b><i>Reset</i></b>.
When neither Set nor Reset is asserted,
the latch simply outputs whatever value was previously stored in it.
</p>

<p>
If we now pulse the Set input, the latch will store the value "1",
and will output "1" on output line Q (and "0" on Q').
After the pulse, the latch continues to remember and output the value "1".
Similarly, pulsing Reset will cause the latch to remember and output "0".
Thus, the latch remembers whichever input line was most recently pulsed.
Set and Reset should never be pulsed at the same time; this is an illegal
combination of inputs for the SR-latch.
The following Verilog module shows an SR-latch:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>module SRlatch (q, qbar, set, reset);
    output q, qbar;
    input set, reset;

    nor #1 (q, qbar, reset);
    nor #1 (qbar, q, set);
endmodule
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the module is defined structurally (i.e. with gates only),
and that both NOR gates have been given a non-zero propagation delay
(the <tt>#1</tt> does this).
</p>

<p>
<b>Propagation delay:</b>
The propagation delay of a circuit is the time it elapses
between a change of an input to propagate and change the output of this circuit.
In Verilog and other HDLs, propagation delays must be modeled
in a gate-level sequential circuit to make it behave properly.
Propagation delay is optional for combinational circuits
but it may have to be considered for the proper simulation of the circuit.
</p>

<p>
Create a new file, <tt>lab7_1.v</tt>, and type the SR-latch into this file.
Add the following test module:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>module testSR(q, qbar, set, reset);
    input q, qbar;
    output set, reset;
    reg set, reset;

    initial begin
        $monitor ($time," q = %d, qbar = %d, set = %d, reset = %d",q, qbar, set, reset);
        set = 0; reset = 0;
        #100 
        set = 1; 
        #100 
        set = 0;		/* Set pulse at $time==100 */
        #100 
        reset = 1;
        #100 
        reset = 0;		/* Reset pulse */
        #100
        set = 1;
        #100 
        set = 0;		/* Set pulse again */
        #100 
        reset = 1;
        #100 
        reset = 0;		/* Reset pulse again */
        #100 
        $finish;		/* Finish simulation */
    end
endmodule

module testBench;
    wire q, qbar, set, reset;
    SRlatch l(q, qbar, set, reset);
    testSR t(q, qbar, set, reset);
endmodule
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the test module both Set and Reset are de-asserted at simulation time zero.
After a delay of 100 time steps, Set is asserted.
After another delay of 100, Set is de-asserted and so on.
</p>

<p>
<b>Value "x":</b>
In Verilog, when the value of a variable is "x",
the value is undetermined, meaning that the value could be either "0" or "1".
When two variables containing "x" and "0" are the inputs to a NOR gate,
the gate output must be "x",
because we do not know what the correct output of the gate should be.
On the other hand, if the two inputs are "x" and "1",
the NOR gate output will be "0", not "x",
because in this case the input "1" is a controlling input.

<h3>2. D-Latch [10 points]</h3>
<b>Structural modeling of D-latch</b>

<p>
To implement and simulate the MIPS processor,
we will need a memory element that changes its state only when a change is permitted,
not just any time its inputs change. One such device is D-latch.
</p>

<p>
As you can see in the figure below,
a D-latch is built from an SR-latch and two AND gates.
D-latch overcomes both drawbacks of SR-latch:
it has a single data input, D, rather than two inputs, Set and Reset.
This prevents the illegal input combination of both Set and Reset asserted.
D-latch has a clock input, which determines when the memory element is permitted
to change the state.
A clock is a free-running periodic signal that alternates
between high ("1") and low ("0") signal levels.
The time needed for the clock to complete one full cycle
(e.g., change from low to high, high to low, and then back to high)
is called a clock cycle denoted by Tcc.
Clock cycles are also known as clock periods,
or sometimes just "clocks" for short.
The exact instant when the clock jumps from a "1" to a "0"
is called a negative clock edge (or falling or trailing).
The instant the clock jumps from a "0" to a "1" is called a positive clock edge (or rising or leading).
</p>

<p>
In D-latch, the pair of AND gates are used to "guard" the embedded SR-latch
by prohibiting the SR-latch's inputs from being pulsed unless the clock signal is "1".
When the clock signal is "0", the latch's output cannot be changed,
regardless of the value of latch's D input.
Thus, D-latch can be updated only when the clock signal permits.
</p>

<b>Clock Signal Generator</b>

<p>
In Verilog a clock signal is easily provided using behavioral modeling.
The following module shows an <tt>m555</tt> "timer" (clock) chip,
which we will use whenever we need a clock signal. <u>Do not modify any given code.</u>
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>module m555(clock);
    parameter InitDelay = 10, Ton = 50, Toff = 50;
    output clock;
    reg clock;

    initial begin
        #InitDelay clock = 1;
    end

    always begin
        #Ton clock = ~clock;
        #Toff clock = ~clock;
    end
endmodule
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <tt>m555</tt> module declares a single output, clock,
which is defined to be an 1-bit Verilog register.
Recall that the <tt>always</tt> keyword defines a Verilog thread of control,
which loops forever updating the clock once every time through the loop.
The clock cycle time is defined to be 100 time steps.
The <tt>initial</tt> keyword defines another thread
that executes only once at $time=0,
to initialize the clock register.
</p>

<p>
Below is the test module for D-latch. Add the test module to your D-latch implementation file. <u>Do not modify any given code.</u>
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>module testD(q, qbar, clock, data);
    input  q, qbar, clock;
    output data;
    reg    data;

    initial begin
        $monitor ($time, " q = %d, qbar = %d, clock = %d, data = %d", q, qbar, clock, data);
        data = 0;
        #25  
        data = 1;
        #100 
        data = 0;
        #50 
        data = 1;
        #50 
        data = 0;
        #100 
        data = 1;
        #50 
        data = 0;
        #50 
        data = 1;
        #100
        $finish; /* $finish simulation after 100 time simulation units */
    end
endmodule

module testBenchD;
    wire clock, q, qbar, data;
    m555 clk(clock);
    Dlatch dl(q, qbar, clock, data);
    testD td(q, qbar, clock, data);
endmodule

<h3>3. D-FF (Flip Flop) [20 points]</h3>
<b>Structural modeling of D-FF</b>

<p>
A D-latch is an example of a level-triggered memory device.
As long as the clock input is at "1",
the latch is "open" and will read and store the data input.
When the clock goes to "0", the latch is "closed",
and the output is not affected by any changes in the data input.
We need a memory element that can only be changed at particular specified moments.
Instead of a level-triggered device that is open for half the clock cycle,
we use a device that can be updated only at those brief instants
when the clock jumps from one level to another.
A clock transition from "1" to "0" is called a negative clock edge (or falling edge),
and we want our memory element to update only when a negative clock edge occurs
(edge-triggered not level-triggered).
We can construct a negative edge-triggered D-FF from two level-triggered D-latches,
as shown below.
These two D-latches work in a master-slave mode.
An inverter negates the clock input to the second latch,
so only one latch can be open at any time.
When the clock signal is "1", the first latch is open and accepts a new value,
but the second latch is closed.
When a negative edge of the clock occurs,
the first latch closes and the second one opens, reading the value stored in the first latch.
</p>

<p>
Below is the test module for D-FF. Add the test module to your D-FF implementation file. <u>Do not modify any given code.</u>

<blockquote>
<pre>module testD(q, qbar, clock, data);
    input  q, qbar, clock;

    reg    data;

    initial begin
        $monitor ($time, " q = %d, qbar = %d, clock = %d, data = %d", q, qbar, clock, data);
        data = 0;
        #25  
        data = 1;
        #100 
        data = 0;
        #50 
        data = 1;
        #50 
        data = 0;
        #100 
        data = 1;
        #50 
        data = 0;
        #50 
        data = 1;
        #100
        $finish; /* $finish simulation after 100 time simulation units */
    end

<h3>4. D-FF with Preset and Clear [30 points]</h3>
<p>
Extend the capabilities of the base D-FF with the Load (also called Write Enable),
Preset and Clear capability.
Let's call this D-FF-PC.
The D-FF-PC will have the additional ports:
Write_en, Preset_b and Clear_b.
The Write_en line is set (to 1) only when we want to allow the D-FF-PC to sample
and store its current input D in its storage (Q, and Q') by gating the input in each D-latch.
The actual storing of the current input takes place
when the clock signal CLK makes the HIGH to LOW transition (negative clock edge).
The Clear_b signal is set to "active low" (i.e., 0) value
when we want to set of the D-FF-PC to <u>0 (Q = 0, and Q' = 1)</u>.
Similarly, the Preset_b is set to "active low" (0) signal value
when we want to preset the D-FF-PC to <u>1 (Q = 1, and Q' = 0)</u>.
Both Clear_b and Preset_b are <u>asynchronous</u> and have precedence over the current clock signal CLK and Write_en. 
Thus, they directly change the output.
However, they can not be active at the same time.
You must implement D-FF-PC with basic gates in gate-level design.
<u>Do not use any reserved Verilog keyword in module D-FF-PC.</u></p>
