                <p>The previous post described <a href="https://manybutfinite.com/post/motherboard-chipsets-memory-map">motherboards and the memory map</a> in
Intel computers to set the scene for the initial phases of boot.  Booting is an
involved, hacky, multi-stage affair - fun stuff. Here's an outline of the
process:</p>
<img src="./How Computers Boot Up _ Many But Finite_files/bootProcess.png" class="center">
<p>Things start rolling when you press the power button on the computer
(no! do tell!). Once the motherboard is powered up it initializes its
own firmware - the chipset and other tidbits - and tries to get the CPU
running. If things fail at this point (e.g., the CPU is busted or
missing) then you will likely have a system that looks completely dead
except for rotating fans. A few motherboards manage to emit beeps for an
absent or faulty CPU, but the zombie-with-fans state is the most common
scenario based on my experience. Sometimes USB or other devices can
cause this to happen: unplugging <em>all</em> non-essential devices is a
possible cure for a system that was working and suddenly appears dead
like this. You can then single out the culprit device by elimination.</p>
<p>If all is well the CPU starts running. In a multi-processor or multi-core system
one CPU is dynamically chosen to be the bootstrap processor (BSP) that runs all
of the BIOS and kernel initialization code. The remaining processors, called
application processors (AP) at this point, remain halted until later on when
they are explicitly activated by the kernel. Intel CPUs have been evolving over
the years but they're fully backwards compatible, so modern CPUs <em>can</em> behave
like the original 1978 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8086" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel 8086</a>, which is exactly what they do
after power up. In this primitive power up state the processor is
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real mode</a> with memory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paging</a> disabled.
This is like ancient
MS-DOS where only 1 MB of memory can be addressed and any code can write to any
place in memory - there's no notion of protection or privilege.</p>
<p>Most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registers</a> in the
CPU have well-defined values after power up, including the instruction
pointer (EIP) which holds the memory address for the instruction being
executed by the CPU. Intel CPUs use a hack whereby even though only 1MB
of memory can be addressed at power up, a hidden base address (an
offset, essentially) is applied to EIP so that the first instruction
executed is at address 0xFFFFFFF0 (16 bytes short of the end of 4 gigs
of memory and well above one megabyte). This magical address is called
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reset_vector" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reset vector</a> and is
standard for modern Intel CPUs.</p>
<p>The motherboard ensures that the instruction at the reset vector is a
<em>jump</em> to the memory location mapped to the BIOS entry point. This jump
implicitly clears the hidden base address present at power up. All of
these memory locations have the right contents needed by the CPU thanks
to the <a href="https://manybutfinite.com/post/motherboard-chipsets-memory-map">memory map</a>
kept by the chipset. They are all mapped to flash memory containing the
BIOS since at this point the RAM modules have random crap in them. An
example of the relevant memory regions is shown below:</p>
<img src="./How Computers Boot Up _ Many But Finite_files/bootMemoryRegions.png" class="center">
<p>The CPU then starts executing BIOS code, which initializes some of the hardware
in the machine. Afterwards the BIOS kicks off the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_on_self_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Power-on Self Test</a>
(POST) which tests various components in the computer. Lack of a working video
card fails the POST and causes the BIOS to halt and emit beeps to let you know
what's wrong, since messages on the screen aren't an option. A working video
card takes us to a stage where the computer looks alive: manufacturer logos are
printed, memory starts to be tested, angels blare their horns. Other POST
failures, like a missing keyboard, lead to halts with an error message on the
screen. The POST involves a mixture of testing and initialization, including
sorting out all the resources - interrupts, memory ranges, I/O ports - for PCI
devices. Modern BIOSes that follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACPI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advanced Configuration and Power
Interface</a> build a number of data tables that describe the devices in
the computer; these tables are later used by the kernel.</p>
<p>After the POST the BIOS wants to boot up an operating system, which must
be found somewhere: hard drives, CD-ROM drives, floppy disks, etc. The
actual order in which the BIOS seeks a boot device is user configurable.
If there is no suitable boot device the BIOS halts with a complaint like
"Non-System Disk or Disk Error." A dead hard drive might present with
this symptom. Hopefully this doesn't happen and the BIOS finds a working
disk allowing the boot to proceed.</p>
<p>The BIOS now reads the first 512-byte
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_sector" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sector</a> (sector zero) of the
hard disk. This is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Master Boot
Record</a> and it normally
contains two vital components: a tiny OS-specific bootstrapping program
at the start of the MBR followed by a partition table for the disk. The
BIOS however does not care about any of this: it simply loads the
contents of the MBR into memory location 0x7c00 and jumps to that
location to start executing whatever code is in the MBR.</p>
<img src="./How Computers Boot Up _ Many But Finite_files/masterBootRecord.png" class="center">
<p>The specific code in the MBR could be a Windows MBR loader, code from
Linux loaders such as LILO or GRUB, or even a virus. In contrast the
partition table is standardized: it is a 64-byte area with four 16-byte
entries describing how the disk has been divided up (so you can run
multiple operating systems or have separate volumes in the same disk).
Traditionally Microsoft MBR code takes a look at the partition table,
finds the (only) partition marked as active, loads the boot sector for
<em>that</em> partition, and runs that code. The <strong>boot sector</strong> is the first
sector of a partition, as opposed to the first sector for the whole
disk. If something is wrong with the partition table you would get
messages like "Invalid Partition Table" or "Missing Operating System."
This message does <strong>not</strong> come from the BIOS but rather from the MBR
code loaded from disk. Thus the specific message depends on the MBR
flavor.</p>
<p>Boot loading has gotten more sophisticated and flexible over time. The
Linux boot loaders Lilo and GRUB can handle a wide variety of operating
systems, file systems, and boot configurations. Their MBR code does not
necessarily follow the "boot the active partition" approach described
above. But functionally the process goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The MBR itself contains the first stage of the boot loader. GRUB
calls this stage 1.</li>
<li>Due to its tiny size, the code in the MBR does just enough to load
another sector from disk that contains additional boostrap code.
This sector might be the boot sector for a partition, but could also
be a sector that was hard-coded into the MBR code when the MBR was
installed.</li>
<li>The MBR code plus code loaded in step 2 then read a file containing
the second stage of the boot loader. In GRUB this is GRUB Stage 2,
and in Windows Server this is c:\NTLDR. If step 2 fails in Windows
you'd get a message like "NTLDR is missing". The stage 2 code then
reads a boot configuration file (e.g., grub.conf in GRUB, boot.ini
in Windows). It then presents boot choices to the user or simply
goes ahead in a single-boot system.</li>
<li>At this point the boot loader code needs to fire up a kernel. It
must know enough about file systems to read the kernel from the boot
partition. In Linux this means reading a file like
"vmlinuz-2.6.22-14-server" containing the kernel, loading the file
into memory and jumping to the kernel bootstrap code. In Windows
Server 2003 some of the kernel start-up code is separate from the
kernel image itself and is actually embedded into NTLDR. After
performing several initializations, NTDLR loads the kernel image
from file c:\Windows\System32\ntoskrnl.exe and, just as GRUB
does, jumps to the kernel entry point.</li>
</ol>
<p>There's a complication worth mentioning (ie, I told you this thing is
hacky). The image for a current Linux kernel, even compressed, does not
fit into the 640K of RAM available in real mode. My vanilla Ubuntu
kernel is 1.7 MB compressed. Yet the boot loader must run in real mode
in order to call the BIOS routines for reading from the disk, since the
kernel is clearly not available at that point. The solution is the
venerable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unreal mode</a>. This
is not a true processor mode (I wish the engineers at Intel were allowed
to have fun like that), but rather a technique where a program switches
back and forth between real mode and protected mode in order to access
memory above 1MB while still using the BIOS. If you read GRUB source
code, you'll see these transitions all over the place (look under
stage2/ for calls to real_to_prot and prot_to_real). At the end of
this sticky process the loader has stuffed the kernel in memory, by hook
or by crook, but it leaves the processor in real mode when it's done.</p>
<p>We're now at the jump from "Boot Loader" to "Early Kernel
Initialization" as shown in the first diagram. That's when things heat
up as the kernel starts to unfold and set things in motion. The next
post will be a guided tour through the Linux Kernel initialization with
links to sources at the <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux Cross Reference</a>. I
can't do the same for Windows ;) but I'll point out the highlights.</p>
<p>[Update: cleared up discussion of NTLDR.]</p>
